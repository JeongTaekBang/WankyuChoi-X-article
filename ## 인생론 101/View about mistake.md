When you make a mistake, the window of opportunity to correct it closes rapidly, often within seconds.

Your chances of successfully making that correction in time directly correlate with how well you've trained your mind through consistent practice and preparation.

Counter-intuitively, the more you try to consciously think your way through a mistake in a panicked state, the less likely you are to correct it. Your brain, when stressed and unreasonable, has an uncanny ability to rationalize errors—either by denying they exist or by leaving the outcome to chance. That's why training your mind in this context is more about building muscle memory than analytical thinking. The goal is to develop automatic responses that bypass your brain's natural tendency to rationalize errors when under pressure.

That sensation of a closing window is actually a positive sign—it indicates growing awareness and a desire to improve. The key is to act on that awareness before the opportunity passes.

Even the most skilled individuals make mistakes. Even gods do. The key isn't to avoid mistakes entirely, but to build the ability to quickly recognize and correct them. Those who have trained effectively can spot and address errors almost immediately, while those with less preparation may hesitate or miss the chance to act before it’s too late.

The first window to correct a mistake is often the hardest to face, yet most crucial. How we handle this moment shapes our response to all future challenges.
