Let me be clear - I aim to avoid misleading anyone.

The future is inherently uncertain. Events can unfold in countless ways, often defying our expectations and predictions.

True confidence should be built on a foundation of knowledge, experience, and deep understanding - not on blind optimism or hollow bravado. This educated confidence, grounded in reality, is essential.

However, even with the most informed perspective, we must remain humble. No amount of education or expertise guarantees success. Losses and failures are inevitable parts of any journey. This is why we must carefully weigh different scenarios and prepare accordingly.

Life has a way of challenging our certainties. With time and experience, we often discover that situations we once viewed with absolute conviction turned out differently than expected. This is a natural part of growth and learning.

Consider this from a different perspective: Imagine yourself as your own child - what approach would you want your parent to take? Would you want them to proceed with unfounded certainty, or with thoughtful, well-reasoned confidence tempered by humility?

The answer becomes clear when we frame it this way.

Remember: ego and hubris serve only the self. While you are an important part of the family, the family's wellbeing extends beyond any individual's pride.
