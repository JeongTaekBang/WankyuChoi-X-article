# How to Convince Yourself You're Darn Serious About Anything and Git Gud

Chances are, your inner self scoffs when you start something new: "Huh, I know you. You won't last a week."

How does it know? Because that's been the case with the last 100 things you started and never finished. That's called average. Your simple stats: typically, you don't finish what you start, and your inner self knows this better than you do.

So how do you convince yourself you're darn serious this time?

Simple. Bump up the average. Do it 101 times. That's the only way to change the slope of that downward curve. Moving averages, anyone? Yeah, there are lessons to be learned even from those pesky chartists in the market.

The heavier the moving average, the harder it is to change direction. A five-day moving average is way easier to bend than a 200-day one. Easy peasy, right?

Now consider your life. Your whole life. What moving average would that produce? 200-day? 500-day? 1000-day? Think again why your inner self is so darn cynical about your new endeavor.

If you haven't done serious things seriously, it'll take more than a decade just to change the direction of that moving average. To get that upward slope, you need to do serious things seriously for a long, long time.

Better late than never, but never late is better.

Are you really serious about what you're doing? Then prove it. Not to anyone else. To your inner self. That's the only way to shut it up.
