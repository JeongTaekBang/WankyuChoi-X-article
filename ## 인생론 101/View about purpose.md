From time to time, take a moment to ask yourself:

"What am I doing this for?"

Give it serious thought and then articulate your most honest answer.

After all, you're the only one who can answer that question and truly listen to the response. Don't fret.

Finally, decide what to do next. You may be amazed at how much clearer this makes things.

More often than not, you should stop doing whatever it is you're currently engaged in and start doing what you know you should be doing but aren't.

The key is to be completely honest with yourself.

I'd wager that most of you wouldn't be doing what you're doing on social media like X if you were truly honest with yourself.
