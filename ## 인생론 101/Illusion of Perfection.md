# Illusion of Perfection

One fascinating insight that emerges when learning to draw is the profound realization that perception varies significantly from person to person.

Consider the concept of likeness in portraiture. Even when a skilled artist renders a famous subject, achieving a perfect likeness proves elusive. Two viewers may have vastly different experiences - one intimately familiar with the subject, the other encountering them for the first time. Even globally recognized figures might not be immediately identifiable to someone unfamiliar with them.

The challenge lies in the inherent limitations of artistic representation. Even masters like Michelangelo had to selectively simplify and normalize information, as a likeness is fundamentally a reduction of the infinitely complex analog data that comprises a real person.

Viewers naturally complete this simplified representation by filling in the missing details. In the absence of contrary influences, they tend to do so in ways that align with their own preferences and experiences.

This explains why artistic reduction is so prevalent across different art forms. In manga, for instance, a simple dot can effectively represent a nose - viewers naturally interpret it in a way that suits the character. For a pretty character, readers tend to envision an appropriately attractive nose. The artist need not strive for perfect anatomical detail. Indeed, doing so might be counterproductive, as it removes the viewer's opportunity to participate in the creative process through their own interpretation.

The artist's role, then, is to provide just enough information to guide the viewer's imagination. This understanding reveals the futility of perfectionism in art. Perfect representation isn't just impossible - it's often undesirable. Why risk compromising the viewer's ability to form their own favorable interpretation? The pursuit of absolute perfection can actually diminish the artwork's effectiveness.

This leads us to a profound conclusion: even if an artist achieves what they consider to be a perfect representation, viewers will inevitably perceive it differently. Two people observing the same subject, from identical positions and lighting conditions, will form distinct mental impressions.

This phenomenon extends even to artists themselves, who often perceive their own works differently as time passes. The common advice to "get a fresh pair of eyes" on your work acknowledges this shifting perspective. One might wonder if Michelangelo, were he to view his David or the Sistine Chapel ceiling today, would still consider them perfect masterpieces. The temporal distance would likely reveal aspects he'd now approach differently, informed by centuries of artistic evolution and his own matured perspective.

Our experience of reality itself is deeply personal and subjectiveâ€”each of us processes sensory information through the unique lens of our consciousness, memories, and accumulated experiences.

This fundamental subjectivity of human perception suggests that there can be no truly universal interpretation of any artwork.

Perhaps, then, we should embrace this inherent diversity of perception, rather than pursuing an impossible ideal of absolute perfection.

To each their own. That's the beauty of it.
