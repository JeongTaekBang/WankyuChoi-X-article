# Why You Keep Losing Money Even in a Bull Market

Here's a hint on why you keep losing money in the market.

Think of what you're doing as drawing.

Mindlessly practicing drawing without a clear plan on what to improve and what mistakes to avoid is akin to trading without a strategy to refine and correct your errors.

As a lifelong language professional, I've seen people repeatedly make the same mistakes. It astonishes me when people practice speaking English without being able to express themselves in writing or understand written text. Reading comprehension should come first when learning a language, followed by writing and then speaking. This progression is natural for adults, unlike children who learn to speak first because they can't read or write. Many adults practice speaking at language institutes, yet they can't read or write simple sentences. How can they expect to improve their language skills or correct mistakes if they don't even recognize them?

The same principle applies to drawing. Unless you're a born genius, you shouldn't mindlessly draw "incorrect" things. Start each practice session with a clear understanding of what to improve and what mistakes to correct. Otherwise, you're just reinforcing your errors and wasting your time, passion, and energy.

Now, back to investing in the market. If you fail repeatedly, it's because you don't know what you're doing wrong. Without a clear plan to improve and avoid mistakes, you're mindlessly trading, reinforcing errors, and wasting your time, passion, and energy.

Object-oriented lessons teach us that you're inheriting bad habits from your entire life. If something keeps failing, you should stop and reflect on what you're doing wrong. This reflection is your life's moving average. To bend that moving average upward, it takes a tremendous effort over a long time. Let that sink in.

What have you learned? Where do you want to improve? What are your weaknesses and strengths? Do you even care?

And you still think you can outdo all those investors who are constantly getting better?

You're dreaming, folks.

Improving anything or honing any skill can be boiled down to simple math. Think of it this way: you have a million things to tackle. With every attempt, aim to get at least one thing right. 

Each time you succeed, that's one less obstacle in your way. 

Over time, that insurmountable mountain of tasks will shrink. You'll begin to see the peak, the summit, the end goal.

Easy, right? Yet, statistically, very few people actually do this. On the flip side, those who do are the ones who succeed. Just by taking action, you're already a better person than the whole bunch of nothing-doers.
