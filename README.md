This repository is for storing articles by 대두족장 from https://x.com/WankyuChoi.

I created this repository to learn how to manage text and use GitHub effectively.

Through these articles, I hope to improve my ability to use object-oriented programming concepts, such as adding attributes and methods to my class.

I am also very grateful to 대두족장 for writing these articles.

Thank you.
