I just had a serious talk with someone deeply embedded in the field, and honestly, I strongly doubt it will last long given the rapid encroachment of AI.

Understandably, people in such fields are on the defensive, and I can't blame them. It's a matter of survival. But I can't help feeling a bit sad for those futilely wishing to hold on to the past.

As always, it's just my two cents, but I'm pretty sure the future is already here. It's just not evenly distributed yet. That's all.

If they're still talking about "whether," and not "when" or "how" in terms of AI and robots replacing humans in their field, they're already behind the curve. More starkly speaking, no matter how expert they are in their field, they're already obsolete. Honestly, I see them as walking dead.

It's time to talk about when and how to adapt, not whether. It's time to talk about how to leverage AI and robots to augment their work, not how to fight them off.

What history lessons did they miss?

This might rub some people the wrong way, but I'm just being honest. I'm not trying to be mean or anything. I'm just stating the facts as I see them. They should too.
